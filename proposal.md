# Intensive Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name: Megan OBryan** 


**Project Name: Course Overload** 


**New or Old? Old idea, starting over for the most part**


**Solo or Team? Solo**


## Description

A college career course planner; starting from the frontend this time.I started building some React components for this project. My past attempts have focused on building the backend primarily, but this will be a fully frontend implementation for the "skateboard" - "car" iterations of this project. 

## Challenges I Anticipate

 - The usual challenges with React and react-dnd (I have more experience with them since last intensive).
 - Challenges of remote work; I left online school for a reason.
 - Making a multi-page react app (I've never done that before).

## Skateboard

Add preloaded courses modals with dummy content; CRUD courses.

## Bike

Make drag and droppable using react-dnd.

## Car

Enforce prerequisite and corequisite course requirements.


## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Make a visually accessible and intuitively usable app to help students plan their courses.
2. Gain more experience with different aspects of react-dnd (for instance, I've never gotten dragging into and out of lists working).
3. Build features to assist the users process.
